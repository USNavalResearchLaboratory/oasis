make sure you have an output subdirectory for the output txt file
This is what compiles on the NRL system with Intel Fortran. It will also work with
gfortran, but I have not used that recently

ifort -w -c -80 -no-ipo -check -traceback -pfe0 -r8 *.f
THEN- make sure you have msis2 ready to go: read_msis.f calls gtd8d


ifort *.o -o oasis_lws.exe 
./oasis_lws > file.log &
